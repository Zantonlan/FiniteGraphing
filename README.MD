# What is it?
It's a finite graphing calculator. For Windows XP to 10. I haven't tested on anything but 10, but nearly everything goes back to Windows 2000, except like 1 thing, so most likely supports XP.

# Building
Simply run
```
gcc main.c -mwindows -o graph.exe
```
and run graph.exe! It's that easy!
